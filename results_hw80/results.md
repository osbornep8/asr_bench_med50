# ASR Contextual-Biasing Benchmark — Results

Term-Recall = exact; Term-Rec(fz) = CER-tolerant (transliteration-robust); Term-CER = mean best per-term CER (lower=better). RTF = latency/audio (local = on-device compute; **API latency/RTF also includes network + their servers — not apples-to-apples**, ADR-0024).
